# Python-Predicting-Diabetes-in-Pima-Women
Using the Pima Indian Women dataset, built and compared machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors in order to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. The accuracy and precision of the algorithms was investigated with KNN being the most accurate model for this dataset. This was the Capstone Project for the Caltech Data Science Bootcamp; it included Exploratory Data Analysis, data cleaning and outlier/NaN value treatment. The algorithms used in this project are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and KNN. An ROC-AUC curve was used to visualize the KNN classifier's ability to distinguish between the diabetic vs non-diabetic outcome.


DESCRIPTION:

NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases. The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
