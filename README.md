# Python-Predicting-Diabetes-in-Pima-Women
Using the Pima Indian Women dataset, built and compared machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors in order to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. The accuracy and precision of the algorithms was investigated with KNN being the most accurate model for this dataset.
